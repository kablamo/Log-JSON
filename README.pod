=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Log::JSON;
    my $logger = Log::JSON->new(

        date            => 1, # optional

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module logs a hash to a file as JSON.  The keys are printed in sorted order.  

Often log files have several raw numbers and strings whose meaning is not
immediately clear.  With JSON formatted text in your log files, a human can
open the file and quickly decipher the content because each piece of
information is labeled.

Using JSON also means log files are easy to parse and the data structures can
be easily revived.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 date

Adds an __date field to your json.  The '__' part ensures the date is the first
information logged to each line when the keys are sorted.

=head2 file

The name of the file to log data to

=head2 remove_newlines

This boolean is set to true by default.  It means your json data structures
will be logged entirely on one line.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 log(%hash)

Appends %hash to a file as JSON.  The keys are sorted when the hash is converted to JSON.

=head1 BUGS

This should probably should have been a Log::Dispatch plugin.
